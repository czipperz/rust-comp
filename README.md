# rust-comp

This project is a compiler for the Rust programming language.

## Goals

* Correctness -- It should never crash and should always output correct source
  code.
* Compilation speed -- That is, it is fast at compiling Rust source code.
* Embeddable -- It should be easy to use the compiler as a library to do static
  analysis and make related tooling.
